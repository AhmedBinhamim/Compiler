# Compiler
This project is a compiler built using Visual Basic that implements fundamental aspects of language design, lexical analysis, and syntax analysis. The compiler takes source code written in a custom programming language and translates it into an intermediate representation.

# Features

Language Design: Implements the core elements of a custom programming language, including its syntax and semantics.
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code into a series of tokens, identifying keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and other elements.
Syntax Analysis: Parses the tokens generated by the lexical analysis phase to ensure they adhere to the grammatical rules of the language, constructing a parse tree.

# Requirements

Visual Basic development environment (e.g., Visual Studio)
.NET Framework (specific version depending on Visual Basic setup)

# Usage

## Compile the project:

Build the solution in Visual Studio to compile the compiler.

## Run the compiler:

Execute the compiled binary or run the project directly from Visual Studio.

## Input Source Code:

Provide the source code written in the custom programming language as input to the compiler.

## View Output:

The compiler will process the input source code and generate an intermediate representation or provide syntax error messages if the code does not conform to the language's grammar rules.
